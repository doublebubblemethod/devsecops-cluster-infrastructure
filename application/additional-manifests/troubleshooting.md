Postres logs error: 
`2025-07-14 21:57:23.817 GMT [7674] ERROR:  permission denied for schema public at character 28
2025-07-14 21:57:23.817 GMT [7674] STATEMENT:  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vets ( id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, first_name TEXT, last_name TEXT )`
exec your postres pod, log into as a user  (postres in my case is db admin user) and check your petclinic user permissions:
`k exec postgres-postgresql-0 -it -n application -- sh`  
`psql -U postgres` to login
`\l` list your tables in the db
`\c petclinic` to get into a specific db 
`\du` List of roles
CREATE USER petclinic WITH PASSWORD 'your pass' CREATEDB;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO petclinic;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE petclinic TO petclinic;

Another postres log that helped me to pinpoint out the issue:
`LOG:  connection authorized: user=petclinic database=petclinic`
I realized that the app's deployment POSTGRES_URL is not correct:
`incorrect value: jdbc:postgresql://postgres-postgresql.application.svc.cluster.local:5432/petclinic` 
`correct value: jdbc:postgresql://postgres-postgresql.application.svc.cluster.local:5432/postgres `
